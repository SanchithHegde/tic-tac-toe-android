# Tic-Tac-Toe (Android)

![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/SanchithHegde/tic-tac-toe-android?label=Version&style=for-the-badge)

Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, implemented in Java. The MCTS algorithm makes the computer almost impossible to beat, thus the worst case scenario (for the computer) would be a draw.

## Features:
- Supports Player vs. Computer mode.
- Follows Material Design guidelines.
- Supports both light and dark themes. Currently, only changes with system theme.

## To-Do:
